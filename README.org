* Kibits - Distributed Game Blockchain Library

A blockchain to track player progression (things like items,
abilities, and currency) within a distributed multiplayer game.

With Kibits, servers that trust one another can allow players to
maintain their progression between servers.

Limits are defined and enforced in each ledger, providing a way to
prove players have earned their progression in a reasonable way, and
allow servers to easily determine if they want to respect the player's
activities on other servers.

Progression earned in untrusted ways can be ignored by a server, and
the player simply won't have access to those portions of their
progression when playing on servers that lack trust.
