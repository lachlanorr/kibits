* Kibits - Distributed Game Blockchain Library

A blockchain to track player progression (things like items,
abilities, and currency) within distributed multiplayer games.

With Kibits, servers that trust one another can allow players to
maintain their progression between servers.

Limits are defined and enforced in each ledger, providing a way to
prove players have earned their progression in a reasonable way, and
allow servers to easily determine if they want to respect the players'
activities on other servers.

Progression earned in untrusted ways can be ignored by a server, and
the player simply won't have access to those portions of their
progression when playing on servers that lack the necessary trust.
